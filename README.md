# Notes Dashboard System

## Overview
The **Notes Dashboard System** is a mini software project developed to demonstrate **Software Configuration Management (SCM)** principles. The system includes a simple login page, a dashboard interface, and basic notes management functionality, using a simple data storage file.

The primary focus of this project is on applying SCM processes — configuration identification, version control, change management, baselines, and releases — rather than developing complex software features.

## Purpose of the Repository
This repository is used to manage and control all configuration items related to the Notes Dashboard System. It contains:

- Project documentation
- Source code
- Data files
- Baseline records
- Release information

All items are managed under **Git** and **GitHub**.

---

## Repository Structure
```
/docs          Project documentation (SCM Plan, CI Register, Change Logs, Baseline Records)
/src           Source code files
/tests         Test-related files
/releases      Release notes and packaged releases
```

---

## SCM Approach
- **Version Control:** Git
- **Repository Hosting & Collaboration:** GitHub (for branching, pull requests, baselines, releases)
- **Change Management:** All changes follow a formal Change Request (CR) process
- **Baselines & Releases:** Baselines are created and tagged to represent approved project snapshots. Only approved configuration items are included in baselines and releases.
